Background Info on Project:

I chose to model the esports location in Lubbock because I work there as a Game Manager. I have gotten to see first hand how covid has affected my work there as well as the interaction with customers. I tried to accurately depict the Esports center to a degree. However I had to remove a lot to prevent lag as well as add a few buttons and words on the walls to help the user figure out interactions within my virtual environment.

Design and Look:

<img src="/Screenshots/FrontDeskNormal.png">

This is the front desk and it is to the right of any new user. On the desk there is a white cabinent with chocolate bars inside to simulate the selling of candy at the front desk for the actual esports center.

<img src="/Screenshots/FrontDeskSideView.png">

Behind the front desk is a set of cabinents that you could not see originally from the front view. You can also see the detail of the desk itself.

<img src="/Screenshots/TableCouchArea.png">

Moving into the lobby area there is a seating area made up of 3 couches and 3 tables. There is also a fan, my animated object, above.
You can see the fan spin in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjlfmUcGePc

<img src="/Screenshots/GameRoomViewNormal.png">

Moving into the main room we see the set up of 8 gaming consols on desks. Each set up consists of 5 objects: The PC, Monitor, Chair, Desk, and Keyboard.
We can see this set up below in the next image:

<img src="/Screenshots/ComputerSetUp.png">

<img src="/Screenshots/ChairInfo.png">

On the wall we have this information telling us that the gaming chairs are interactable.
Each chair can be interacted with as many times as you want.
In this link we can see the interaction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pagkRONZXIE


Next we have Light Controls

<img src="/Screenshots/ColorControls.png">

These controls control the color and brightness or darkness of the lights as well.
This next Video shows the controls being used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_pM5NvbjQo


We also have a similar controls with Covid mode as well:

<img src="/Screenshots/CovidControls.png">

When the button is clicked it affect two areas.
The first area is the gaming area. It removes every other chair. This represents the 6 ft social distancing rule.
The second area affected is the front desk area. When Covid mode is on it adds a sign showing masks are required.
Covid mode can be turned on and off as many times as you want.

<img src="/Screenshots/CovidModeFrontDesk.png">

We can see Covid mode in detail in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_2zNySqZRM


We also have sound. Now at the actual esports place there is music playing 24/7. However to simulate a sound when clicking a object. I designed the music to be clicked before the music starts. However i did decide to make it play 24/7 once clicked so be careful because the music gets annoying.
The music controls are similar to everything else:

<img src="/Screenshots/Music.png">

We can see this also in deatail here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QIUvZmwCKA

Please Note when I did my voice over: I unsynced the audio somehow. However when you test the demo it works correctly.
